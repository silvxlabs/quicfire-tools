	abstract = {Coupled fire-atmospheric modeling tools are increasingly used to understand the complex and dynamic behavior of wildland fires. Multiple research tools linking combustion to fluid flow use Navier-Stokes numerical solutions coupled to a thermodynamic model to understand fire-atmospheric feedbacks, but these computational fluid dynamics approaches require high-performance computing resources. We present a new simulation tool called QUIC-Fire to rapidly solve these feedbacks by coupling the mature 3-D rapid wind solver QUIC-URB to a physics-based cellular automata fire spread model Fire-CA. QUIC-Fire uses 3-D fuels inputs similar to the CFD model FIRETEC, allowing this tool to simulate effects of fuel structure on local winds and fire behavior. Results comparing fire behavior metrics to the computational fluid dynamic model FIRETEC show strong agreement. QUIC-Fire is the first tool intended to provide an opportunity for prescribed fire planners to compare, evaluate, and design burn plans, including complex ignition patterns and coupled fire-atmospheric feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Acquiring detailed 3D fuel data for advanced fire models remains challenging, particularly at large scales. To address this need, we present FastFuels, a novel platform designed to generate detailed 3D fuel data and accelerate the use of advanced fire models. FastFuels integrates existing fuel and spatial data with innovative modeling techniques to represent complex 3D fuel arrangements across landscapes. It leverages data sources including the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database and plot imputation maps, and incorporates advanced features such as data assimilation from LiDAR. This research demonstrates FastFuels’ capabilities through two applications: evaluating fuel treatment effectiveness with the Fire Dynamics Simulator and simulating a prescribed fire operation using QUIC-Fire. FastFuels provides previously unavailable 3D fuel data at landscape scales, empowering informed decision-making, detailed investigations of fuel treatment impacts, and higher-resolution risk assessments. Its flexible data assimilation and model-agnostic outputs accelerate advanced fire science and support fire management decisions.},
