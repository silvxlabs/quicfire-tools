$fire_flag         ! Fire flag: 1 = run fire; 0 = no fire
$random_seed               ! Random number generator: -1: use time and date, any other integer > 0 is used as the seed
! FIRE TIMES
$time_now		    ! When the fire is ignited in Unix Epoch time (integer seconds since 1970/1/1 00:00:00). Must be greater or equal to the time of the first wind
$sim_time			! Total simulation time for the fire [s]
$fire_time_step		! time step for the fire simulation [s]
$quic_time_step		! Number of fire time steps done before updating the quic wind field (integer, >= 1)
$out_time_fire      ! After how many fire time steps to print out fire-related files (excluding emissions and radiation)
$out_time_wind      ! After how many quic updates to print out wind-related files
$out_time_emis_rad  ! After how many fire time steps to average emissions and radiation
$out_time_wind_avg  ! After how many quic updates to print out averaged wind-related files
! FIRE GRID
$nz					! Number of vertical layers of fire grid cells (integer)
$stretch_grid_flag  ! Vertical stretching flag: 0 = uniform dz, 1 = custom
$_stretch_grid_input ! m, dz
! FILE PATH
""
1                   ! Fuel types are in separate files
2                   ! File is stream (1) or headers (2)
! FUEL
$_fuel_density_lines$_fuel_moisture_lines$_fuel_height_lines
! IGNITION LOCATIONS
$_ignition_lines
$ignitions_per_cell ! number of ignitions
! FIREBRANDS
$firebrand_flag		! 0 = off, 1 = on
! OUTPUT FILES (formats depend on the grid type flag)
$eng_to_atm_out		! Output gridded energy-to-atmosphere (3D fire grid + extra layers)
$react_rate_out		! Output compressed array reaction rate (fire grid)
$fuel_dens_out		! Output compressed array fuel density (fire grid)
$qf_wind_out	    ! Output gridded wind (u,v,w,sigma) (3D fire grid)
$qu_wind_inst_out	! Output gridded QU winds with fire effects, instantaneous (QUIC-URB grid)
$qu_wind_avg_out	! Output gridded QU winds with fire effects, averaged (QUIC-URB grid)
0					! Output plume trajectories (ONLY FOR DEBUG)
$fuel_moist_out		! Output compressed array fuel moisture (fire grid)
$mass_burnt_out		! Output vertically-integrated % mass burnt (fire grid)
$firebrand_out		! Output trajectories firebrands
$emissions_out		! Output compressed array emissions (fire grid)
$radiation_out		! Output gridded thermal radiation (fire grid)
$surf_eng_out       ! Output surface fire intensity at every fire time step
! AUTOKILL
$auto_kill          ! Kill if the fire is out and there are no more ignitions or firebrands (0 = no, 1 = yes)
